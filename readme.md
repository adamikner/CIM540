MIDTERM DESCRIPTION

Interactive Piano Simon Says Game

The game is essentially based off a simple piano graphic (generated by rectangles and lines in the sketch file). The premise of the game is similar to other classic “simon-says” games. One at a time, a single key on the piano will be highlighted a certain color, and the user must memorize and repeat the pattern by hitting the same letter key on the computer’s keyboard in the same order. Each time the user repeats the pattern, an additional piano key/note will be added to the end. If the user plays back the incorrect pattern, then something will indicate that they messed up, and they can restart the game.

Ideas for indicating the wrong pattern: All the keys light up, there is an error tone, combination of both



CODE PLAN

Inputs:

    Button: Click button to start
    KeyPressed: Click computer keys that correspond to piano keys in the same order/pattern they are highlited on the piano

Outputs:

    Random Fills: Once start button is clicked, a single key will be highlited one at a time to form a pattern
    
    Additional Random Fill: After user properlly presses correct computer keys in the order of the fills, an additional random fill will occur at the end of the pattern, adding one more note for the user to remember and play back
    
    All Keys Filled: When the user presses an incorrect computer key, all the piano keys will fill with a color to indicate the game is over
    
Psuedocode:
    
    
    1.Set up: random fill Var = false
                All fill var = false
    Button: Click button to start
    click makes random fill var = true
    
  2.  First key is filled with color for a portion of time, maybe with a millis counter
    
   3. keys return to all plain/no fill
    
   4. User presses computer key(s) to perform same pattern as piano
        KeyPressed function
   
   5.If correct, repeat steps 2-4, continuing to add another highlighted key to the pattern each time. Complete pattern is shown again after each correct computer key repeat. 
   
   6. Maybe create each rect key as an array? And have the random fill be done with arrays? Maybe I will need an additional counter (besides millis interval counter) to add an additional random fill after each sequence
   
   7. If user presses wrong key, random fill var = false
                                All fill var = true
                                All keys fill to indicate the game is over
                                
    8. Returns to step 1
